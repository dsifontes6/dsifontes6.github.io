    <h1>DISTRESS SIGNAL - Released December 26th, 2025</h1>
    <p>
        A space simulation where choices matter as you struggle to contact or aid a space base under threat. <br /> 19k+ words. 45+ endings. About 20 minutes per play-through. <br />
    </p> <br />

    <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <p>I challenged myself to handle every step of the pipeline with DISTRESS SIGNAL and picked up the basics on modeling via Blender and texturing via Krita pixel art, on top of
    writing a significant amount for the narrative and dabbling in music production and integrating all of this with what I already knew about making a cohesive game. 
    Along with these sparse creative skills I picked up, I learned a lot about project management from blending them together.</p>
