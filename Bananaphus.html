    <h1>Bananaphus - Released February 3rd, 2025</h1>
    <p>
        A short but difficult game where you're a banana car and chain yourself to the boulder to pull it up the hill.<br />
        The banana is very difficult to control on the hill and the ball is always rolling down.  The chain is very sturdy but not unbreakable. Even with mastery of the controls, summiting the hill takes a lot of time.<br />

    <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <p>Bananaphus was my learning project as my first ever game and allowed me to familiarize myself with the Godot game engine and scripting, primarily.</p>
